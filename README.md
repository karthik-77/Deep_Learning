Lenet Classifier has been applied on the Mnist dataset. This dataset is present in keras.datasets library and hence one can run the program as such wihtout any change.

Alexnet CNN was used to classify natural scenes. The natural scenes dataset needs to be downloaded to the local machine (from url:https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/data#)  and the corresponding paths for reading training and testing files have to be changed in the code to make the program work as desired. 

Transfer learning method was used on VGG16. The pretrained model was used to classify natural scenes.The natural scenes dataset needs to be downloaded to the local machine (from url:https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/data#)  and the corresponding paths for reading training and testing files have to be changed in the code to make the program work as desired. 

Word2_Vec-LSTM model to classify movie reviews has been implemented. The word2_vec embedding have downloaded from https://tfhub.dev/google/Wiki-words-250/2
